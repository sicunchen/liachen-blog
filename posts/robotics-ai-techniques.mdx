I started the OMSCS journey at Georgia Tech in Spring 2024. I originally wanted to take both Computational Photography and this course, but the workload was too intense so I dropped CP promptly. It turned out that RAIT is a great course to get a taste of this program and the pace/workload is definitely suitable for someone working fulltime. I'd like to showcase the assignments I've worked on during this course, which are all combinations of cool concepts + fun graphics + hours of tuning!

## Kalman Filter - HopScotch

When you're stranded in the galaxy and you can only navigate via jumps, suddenly there's a shower of asteroids coming by, what do you? Sounds like a perfect setup for hitchhiking. But how do we know where the asteroids are going to be in the next second? Well if you're an astronaut who knows Kalman Filter you're in luck. At the high level, Kalman Filter takes the current observation and **predict** the position of each asteroid for the next timestep using the motion model, and then use the observation from the next timestep to **correct** the prediction. This part of the project is basically creating the KF matrixes and feeding the current observations to the algorithm. In the next part we have to decide which asteroid to hop on, which is limited by the jumping range and world bounds. To get home faster, the velocity of the asteroid is also an important variable to consider. This is what it looks like when the spaceship hopstoches thru the galaxy and gets home safely:
