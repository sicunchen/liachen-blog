2024 was a lot. Got so burnt out at work that I took a two-month break to cool off. Got married to mon petit ami??!! Enrolled in two hard courses and ended up dropping both because I got overwhelmed and rage-quit. Travelled to Yunnan and hiked at the foot of Meili Snow Mountain in Shangri-la. Phew.

To start this year on a strong foot, I opted for something easier for the spring term: ML4T and CN. Computer Network is the perfect course when you want to cruise. I need to finish this degree on time and feel absolutely no shame in taking this easy A. Just do the good ole rote learning and you'll be fine. The only takeaway for me from this course is the modern internet architecture and probably the only worthy part to retain.

Machine Learning 4 Trading, on the other hand, gives very gentle introduction to concepts like decision tree and reinforcement learning. To me the most interesting part of this course is actually not the ML part but the concise yet informative textbook written by Professor Trucker. It gives me a peek into the finance world and I find it very refreshing. Report construction is farily easy with clean rubrics although sometimes it felt like reading thru the assignemnt specification took longer than actually finishing the report. Another breezy course if you want to chill out a bit.

After a relaxing spring term I decided to face the inevitable academic hazing that is CS7641 Machine Learning. I told myself I will take whatever grade in the end as long as I absorbed the key concepts. I did not enjoy the lectures at all and instead used the Stanford CS229 lectures for the supervised and unsupervised learning modules, which helped dig deep into the math derivation behind each algortihm unlike the constant 2-min banter in the course lectures. For the reports, this term they provided two datasets but one of them, the cancer dataset, is really hard to work with because the features barely contain any information to learn from. The lack of rubrics is the infamous hazing part and the only improvement this term is the reviewer response to which you can submit two more pages of revision and get half of the missing scores back. Overall I hoverred around the average throughout the whole course and am ok with that (Got a B after curve). I find the unsupervised learning concepts, clustering (especially GMM model with probabilistic output for each cluster), PCA and ICA, pretty fascinating and am satifisted with the amount of knowledge I took in. It felt like for the first time as a student I did not let my neurosis deter me and that's good enough!!
